# Title: Testing Page Break Preservation

## Chapter 1: Introduction

This is the first chapter with some content that explains the basics of our topic.

We continue with more information here.

<!-- pagebreak -->

This text appears after a manual page break. Notice how it should start on a new page.

## Chapter 2: Advanced Topics

This chapter begins as usual with the configured page break before chapters.

---pagebreak---

But here we have a manual page break in the middle of the chapter.

\newpage

And another one using LaTeX notation.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

And yet another using HTML style notation.

## Chapter 3: Conclusion

The final chapter to wrap things up.
