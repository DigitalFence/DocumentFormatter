Chapter 1: Test Chapter

This is a simple blockquote test:

Vāg vai brahma | vācā hy evedaṃ sarvaṃ sṛṣṭam | vācā hy evedaṃ sarvaṃ bhavati ||

Speech indeed is Brahman. By speech alone is all this created. By speech alone does all this exist.

— Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 33.6

This should appear only once after the blockquote.

The End.
