Chapter 1: The Primordial Word - Where All Speech is Born
"vācaḥ catvāri padāni vidur brāhmaṇā ye manīṣiṇaḥ |
guhā trīṇi nihitā neṅgayanti turīyaṃ vāco manuṣyā vadanti ||"
"Speech has been measured out in four parts,
The wise who understand know them,
Three parts, concealed in secret, humans do not activate,
The fourth part of speech is what men speak."
•	Atharva Veda 19.71.1
The Mystery at the Heart of Language
Picture this: You're sitting with an old friend in your favorite café. The afternoon light slants through the window, steam rises from your cups, and suddenly–without planning–you find yourself sharing something you've never told anyone. The words seem to come from somewhere deeper than thought, truer than strategy. Your friend's eyes soften with understanding, and in that moment, you both know something sacred has occurred.
What just happened? According to the Atharva Veda, you've just experienced all four levels of speech working in harmony–a rare occurrence in our surface-skimming world.
The ancient seers who composed these verses weren't armchair philosophers. They were explorers of consciousness who discovered through deep meditation that human speech operates simultaneously on multiple levels, most of which remain hidden from ordinary awareness. They mapped these levels with the precision of cartographers charting unknown territories.
Think of it like an iceberg. We see and hear only the tip–what the Vedas call Vaikharī, manifest speech. But beneath the surface lie vast dimensions of communication that actually determine whether our words heal or harm, connect or separate, transform or merely fill space.
Parā Vāk: The Ocean of Silence
At the deepest level lies Parā Vāk–supreme speech that hasn't yet become speech at all. It's the pregnant silence from which all words are born, what poet Rainer Maria Rilke called "the breathing of statues."
I remember sitting with my grandmother in her final days. She had passed beyond the ability to speak, yet communication flowed between us with pristine clarity. Her eyes would meet mine, and entire conversations would pass in that glance–forgiveness offered and received, love acknowledged, peace transmitted. We were swimming together in Parā, where all souls meet before words divide us.
Modern neuroscience has begun to map this territory. Dr. Anil Seth's research on consciousness shows that beneath our conscious awareness lies a vast predictive matrix–the brain's constant modeling of reality that precedes and shapes all experience. When we speak from Parā, we're accessing this deeper intelligence that knows far more than our conscious mind can grasp.
The mystics of all traditions have pointed to this source. Meister Eckhart wrote, "God's greatest gift is wordless." The Sufi master Rumi advised, "Sell your cleverness and buy bewilderment." They're all pointing to the same truth–real communication begins in the silence before words.
Paśyantī Vāk: The Flash of Seeing
From that ocean of silence, the first movement toward expression arises–Paśyantī, the "seeing" speech. This is the realm of sudden insights, creative breakthroughs, and intuitive knowing. It's Einstein glimpsing relativity, Kekulé seeing the benzene ring in a dream, or you suddenly understanding exactly what your teenager needs to hear, even if they haven't told you.
A sculptor once told me, "I don't create the sculpture. I just remove everything that isn't it." That's Paśyantī–seeing what wants to emerge before the rational mind gets involved. It's why our best ideas come in the shower, on walks, or in that drowsy state between sleep and waking. The analytical mind has stepped aside, allowing deeper intelligence to surface.
Dr. John Kounios studies these "aha moments" using EEG technology. He's found that insights are preceded by a burst of gamma waves in the brain's right hemisphere–the very region associated with holistic processing and pattern recognition. The ancients called it "seeing"; neuroscience calls it "gamma synchrony." Different languages, same truth.
Madhyamā Vāk: The Workshop of Thought
At the Madhyamā level, that flash of insight begins to take form as organized thought. This is where the wordless becomes word-able, where the infinite gets carved into the finite shapes of concepts and language.
Watch yourself in this process. You have something to say–you can feel it pressing from within. But it's not yet words. It's more like a pressure, a fullness, a knowing that seeks expression. Then comes the fascinating alchemy as this knowing clothes itself in language, choosing from your vocabulary the best approximations of truth.
This is where things often go sideways. How many times have you said something and immediately thought, "That's not what I meant"? At the Madhyamā level, the infinite richness of Paśyantī must squeeze itself through the narrow doorway of language, and something is always lost in translation.
Yet when we're conscious of this process, magic can happen. Poets know this magic. So do lovers, truth-tellers, and anyone who has ever found exactly the right words at exactly the right moment. It's not about perfection–it's about alignment, allowing the deeper levels to inform and infuse our mental formations.
Vaikharī Vāk: Where the Rubber Meets the Road
Finally, we arrive at Vaikharī–manifest speech, the words that actually leave our lips and enter the world. By the time speech reaches this level, it has traveled an immense journey from silence through vision through thought to sound.
Here's where the Atharva Veda drops a bombshell: most of us only activate this final quarter of speech's potential. We're like musicians playing incredible instruments but only using one string. The three deeper levels remain dormant, untapped, waiting.
No wonder our communications often feel hollow, our conversations unsatisfying, our words impotent to create the changes we seek. We're trying to build cathedrals with only the top floor, attempting surgery with just the scalpel's tip.
The Modern Epidemic of Surface Speech
Scroll through social media for five minutes, and you'll see Vaikharī gone wild–millions of words divorced from their deeper source, creating noise without music, heat without light. We've become so enamored with the speed and reach of our communication technologies that we've forgotten to ask: What am I actually communicating? From what depth am I speaking?
The corporate world perfected this disconnect. I once consulted for a company where meetings were performances of surface speech–hours of words carefully crafted to say nothing real. The employees were dying inside, creativity was flatlined, and everyone knew it, but the show went on. It wasn't until the CEO had a health crisis and returned speaking from a different place–vulnerable, real, connected to deeper sources–that transformation became possible.
Neuroscience Illuminates Ancient Wisdom
Dr. Iain McGilchrist's groundbreaking work on brain hemispheres offers a fascinating parallel to the Vedic understanding. He shows that the right hemisphere–associated with wholeness, context, and implicit understanding–actually comprehends reality first. The left hemisphere then translates this into explicit, sequential communication.
When we speak only from Vaikharī, we're essentially letting our left hemisphere run the show while ignoring the deeper wisdom of right-hemisphere perception. It's like trying to describe a symphony by reading the musical notation without ever hearing the music.
Dr. Stephen Porges's Polyvagal Theory adds another dimension. He's shown that our nervous system state profoundly affects how we communicate. When we're in ventral vagal state (safe and connected), we naturally access deeper levels of speech. When we're in sympathetic arousal (fight or flight) or dorsal vagal shutdown, we're locked into surface patterns.
The Practice: Awakening All Four Levels
So how do we activate these dormant dimensions? The Atharva Veda isn't just descriptive–it's prescriptive. Through practice, we can learn to consciously engage all four levels.
Start with this experiment: Tomorrow morning, before you speak your first words, sit quietly for five minutes. Feel into the silence within you–that's Parā. Notice what wants to be expressed today–that's Paśyantī beginning to stir. Let it take shape as intention or prayer–Madhyamā forming. Only then speak your first words, letting them carry the fragrance of all the levels they've traveled through.
One CEO I worked with began every meeting this way–thirty seconds of silence before anyone spoke. "It completely changed our culture," she told me. "People started speaking from a different place. Real things got said. Problems that had festered for years suddenly found solutions."
The Daily Descent and Ascent
Every communication is an opportunity to practice this descent from silence to speech and the return journey back to silence. It's like breathing–the in-breath draws from Parā through Paśyantī to Madhyamā, the out-breath releases through Vaikharī back to silence.
A therapist friend describes her work this way: "I listen for what's trying to emerge from the client's silence. I feel it moving through the layers, and I help midwife it into words. Sometimes the most profound healing happens in recognizing what doesn't need to be said."
Beyond Individual Practice
When groups learn to communicate from all four levels, extraordinary things happen. I've witnessed corporate teams breakthrough decades-old conflicts, families heal generational wounds, and communities find innovative solutions to seemingly impossible challenges.
The key is creating conditions where deeper levels feel safe to emerge. This requires:
Time: You can't rush the journey from silence to speech. Our instantaneous communication culture works against depth. Building in pauses, silence, and reflection time allows the deeper levels to contribute.
Safety: The vulnerable truth of Paśyantī and Madhyamā only emerges in psychologically safe spaces. One harsh judgment, one broken confidence, and these levels retreat into hiding.
